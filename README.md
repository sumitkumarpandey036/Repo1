What I Actually Do (besides surviving deadlines):

â€¢ Train Al to make smarter decisions than my morning brain - built fraud detectors, stock predictors, and chatbots with 90%+ accuracy Designed apps that don't just look cool they actually work (hello, Carvibe and weather app) Fought bugs like a Marvel hero while building face detection & movie recommendation systems (no capes, just Python & OpenCV) Created real-time Android apps using Jetpack Compose, APIs, and a bit

of magic to track fitness & forecast weather - all before breakfast

Achievements That Make Me Blush: 5x Hackathon Warrior | 3x Winner | 2x

Why Me? I don't iust write code - I tell tech stories. mentor minds, and build things that actually matter Let's turn your "what if" into "what's next"

Let's build something awesome together! (And yes, I test my code. most of the time.)
